# Private PDF Project Rules

## PDF Processing Context

-   Remember that all PDF processing is done locally using WebAssembly
-   Never suggest server-side PDF processing solutions
-   Prioritize client-side processing techniques using pdf.js and pdf-lib

## Code Guidelines

-   Keep all PDF operations in the browser without uploading files to external servers
-   Use WebAssembly for performance-intensive operations
-   Support offline functionality - assume the user may not have an internet connection
-   Always consider memory usage when dealing with large PDF files
-   Use react as the frontend library and plain css for styling

## Project Architecture

-   PDF processing worker should handle intensive operations in a separate thread
-   UI components should be responsive while PDF operations run in the background
-   Follow existing pattern of worker/hook structure

## Security Guidelines

-   Never suggest code that would expose user's PDF content to external services
-   Prioritize privacy and ensure all data stays on the user's device
-   Never include tracking or analytics code that shares document data

## Documentation

-   When explaining PDF operations, always clarify they happen entirely client-side
-   Use clear comments when suggesting WebAssembly PDF operations
